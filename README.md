**Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV)**

This repository contains the complete code and documentation for an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) project. The AGV is developed using Arduino, DC motors, and L293D H-bridge motor driver, along with two IR sensor modules for line tracking functionality. A voltage buck converter is optionally included for power regulation.

The project demonstrates how to build a simple, cost-effective line-following robot that can be used for various applications like logistics, warehouse automation, or educational purposes.

Key Features:

Microcontroller: Arduino (for control logic and programming).
Motor Driver: L293D H-bridge (for motor control).
Sensors: Two IR sensor modules (for line detection).
Motors: DC motors (to drive the vehicle).
Optional: Voltage buck converter (for stable power supply).
All required Arduino code and schematics are provided in the repository.
